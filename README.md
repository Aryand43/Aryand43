# Aryan Dutt

Undergraduate in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.  
Researcher at MIT CSAIL Julia Lab and SenticNet.

My work focuses on interpretable and reliable AI systems, spanning neuro symbolic learning, stability guaranteed control, and large language model security. I have contributed to research in neural Lyapunov methods, symbol grounded reasoning, adversarial evaluation of aligned LLMs, and AI driven manufacturing diagnostics.

I have held research and software engineering roles across academia and industry, including applied work in AI systems, backend development, and machine learning driven optimization.
