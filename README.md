# Aryan Dutt

I am an undergraduate in Computing and Artificial Intelligence at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I currently collaborate with the Julia Lab at MIT CSAIL on neural Lyapunov controllers and with the College of Computing and Data Science at NTU on large language model security.

My work spans scalable AI systems, quantitative modeling, federated learning, and backend infrastructure. I have held research and software roles across deeptech, quantitative finance, manufacturing, and robotics. These include Whisper fine-tuning for dialect adaptation, portfolio optimization pipelines, anomaly detection systems, and real-time control for additive manufacturing.

I am also the Director of Technology at IEEE NTU, a contributor to open-source ML infrastructure, and a participant in multiple startup and research ecosystems focused on applied AI.
